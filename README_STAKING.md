3. **MockERC20.sol** - Testing token implementation:
   - ✅ Standard ERC20 functionality
   - ✅ Mint/burn capabilities for testing
   - ✅ Configurable decimals and initial supply

4. **SimpleApeCoinStaking.sol** - Standalone version:
   - ✅ Full staking functionality without upgrade dependencies
   - ✅ Same core features as upgradeable version
   - ✅ Suitable for environments without OpenZeppelin dependencies

### 🧪 Advanced Testing Suite

**ApeCoinStakingFuzz.t.sol** - Comprehensive fuzz testing covering:
- ✅ Multi-user staking scenarios with random amounts
- ✅ Staking cap enforcement with boundary testing
- ✅ Reward calculation validation across different time periods
- ✅ Withdrawal mechanisms with partial and full withdrawals
- ✅ Emergency withdraw procedures and access control
- ✅ Contract upgrade testing from V1 to V2
- ✅ Pause/unpause functionality validation
- ✅ Error case handling and edge conditions
- ✅ Realistic usage scenarios with multiple operations

### 🚀 Deployment & Infrastructure

1. **Foundry Configuration** (`foundry.toml`):
   - Optimized Solidity compiler settings
   - Comprehensive fuzz testing configuration (1000 runs)
   - OpenZeppelin remappings for dependency management
   - Network configurations for mainnet and testnet deployment

2. **Deployment Scripts**:
   - `DeployApeCoinStaking.s.sol` - Complete deployment automation
   - `UpgradeApeCoinStaking.s.sol` - Upgrade orchestration script
   - `DeploySimpleStaking.sol` - Alternative deployment for simple version

3. **Hardhat Compatibility**:
   - Configuration files for Hardhat development environment
   - Test structure compatible with both Foundry and Hardhat
   - Package.json scripts for compilation and testing

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Security Features
- **Reentrancy Protection**: All state-changing functions protected
- **Access Control**: Owner-only functions with proper validation
- **Pause Mechanism**: Emergency pause capability for critical situations
- **Safe Math**: Overflow protection via Solidity 0.8+ built-in checks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking
- **Event Logging**: Complete audit trail for all operations

### Upgradeability Pattern
- **UUPS Proxy Pattern**: Gas-efficient upgradeable contracts
- **Storage Layout Safety**: Proper variable ordering for upgrade compatibility
- **Initialization Guards**: Protection against multiple initialization
- **Version Management**: Clear versioning strategy with reinitializers

### Gas Optimization
- **Efficient Storage**: Optimized storage layout and access patterns
- **Minimal External Calls**: Reduced gas costs through efficient contract design
- **Batch Operations**: Support for multiple operations in single transaction (`exit()`)

## 📋 Testing Coverage Analysis

The fuzz testing suite provides comprehensive coverage:

| Feature | Test Coverage | Fuzz Scenarios |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Staking | ✅ Complete | Single/multi-user, various amounts |
| Withdrawals | ✅ Complete | Partial/full, boundary conditions |
| Rewards | ✅ Complete | Time-based accumulation, claiming |
| Caps | ✅ Complete | Enforcement, updates, edge cases |
| Emergency | ✅ Complete | Owner actions, access control |
| Upgrades | ✅ Complete | V1→V2 transition, state preservation |
| Error Handling | ✅ Complete | Invalid inputs, unauthorized access |
| Pause/Unpause | ✅ Complete | State transitions, operation blocking |

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Basic Staking Flow
```solidity
// 1. Approve tokens
stakingToken.approve(stakingContract, amount);

// 2. Stake tokens
stakingContract.stake(amount);

// 3. Wait for rewards to accumulate...

// 4. Claim rewards
stakingContract.claimReward();

// 5. Withdraw staked tokens
stakingContract.withdraw(amount);
```

### Admin Operations
```solidity
// Update reward rate
stakingContract.setRewardRate(newRate);

// Update staking cap
stakingContract.setStakingCap(newCap);

// Emergency procedures
stakingContract.pause();
stakingContract.emergencyWithdraw(userAddress);
```

### Contract Upgrade Process
```solidity
// Deploy new implementation
ApeCoinStakingUpgradeableV2 newImpl = new ApeCoinStakingUpgradeableV2();

// Upgrade proxy
stakingContract.upgradeToAndCall(
    address(newImpl),
    abi.encodeWithSelector(
        ApeCoinStakingUpgradeableV2.initializeV2.selector,
        "v2.0.0",
        minimumStakeAmount
    )
);
```

## 🛠 Development Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Foundry
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup

# Install Node.js dependencies (optional)
npm install
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive fuzz tests
forge test

# Run with detailed output
forge test -vvv

# Run specific test patterns
